# Product Mission (Lite)

Cell Body System (CBS) is a modular microservice framework that helps developers build scalable, maintainable distributed systems by providing a biological-inspired architecture with ultra-modular cells, message-driven communication, and polyglot runtime support.

CBS serves enterprise development teams and microservice architects who need maintainable distributed systems with clear separation of concerns. Unlike traditional microservice frameworks that create complexity through tight coupling, CBS provides ultra-modular "cells" with single responsibilities, contract-driven development, and true polyglot support through standardized message contracts and language-specific runtime pools.

## Contributing

### Workflow
- Use short branches: feature/fix/docs.
- PR titles follow Conventional Commits.
- Keep edits small and focused.

### Standards
- Code must pass CI: Rust (`cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy`, `cargo test`), Python (Ruff, Black, PyTest), Flutter (`flutter analyze`, `flutter test`).
- Update docs for major changes (`ai/docs/*`, `README.md`).
- Use checklists in PRs; all items must be checked.

### Commit guidance
- Use conventional types: feat, fix, docs, chore, ci, test, refactor.
- Squash cleanly before merge.

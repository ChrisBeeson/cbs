# Flutter Flow Web - Development History

## 2025-09-19

### CBS Architecture Update
- **Context**: Removed strict cell guards, allowing modular internal cell design
- **Changes**: 
  - Updated CBS principles to allow larger cells with internal components
  - Maintained bus-only communication requirement
  - Enhanced cell modularity and reusability focus
- **Impact**: Cells can now be more substantial while preserving isolation principles

### Task Tracking System
- **Added**: `tasks.md` for active task management
- **Added**: `history.md` for development timeline
- **Process**: Spec-first development workflow established

### Navbar Feature Planning
- **Context**: Adding navigation bar with screen switching functionality
- **Approach**: Breaking feature into modular cells for reusability
- **Cells Identified**: 
  - `navigation_manager` (logic) - Route state management
  - `navbar_ui` (ui) - Navigation interface
  - `screen_*` cells (ui) - Individual screen components
- **Bus Communication**: Using `cbs.navigation.*` subjects for screen switching
- **Task Breakdown**: Created comprehensive task list (NAV100-500 series) for implementation
- **Implementation Order**: navigation_manager → navbar_ui → screen cells → integration

## Development Patterns Established

### Feature Addition Workflow
1. **Analyze Feature**: Break down into modular cell opportunities
2. **Update Specs**: Modify/create `ai/spec.md` files first
3. **Implement Changes**: Follow spec-driven development
4. **Update Dependencies**: Adjust `birthmap.yaml` if needed
5. **Test Integration**: Verify bus communication patterns

### Cell Modularity Guidelines
- Look for single-responsibility opportunities
- Consider reusability across applications
- Maintain clear bus interfaces
- Document cell interactions in specs

### Documentation Standards
- Keep history chronological and contextual
- Link decisions to architectural principles
- Track impact of changes on system design
- Reference specific cells and files changed

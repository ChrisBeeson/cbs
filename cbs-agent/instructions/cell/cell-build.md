# Build CBS Cell

## Overview

Implement a CBS cell from its approved specification using TDD, proper bus communication, and cell isolation principles. Generate tasks, implement code, and validate integration.

<step number="1" name="validate_cell_ready_for_build">

### Step 1: Validate Cell Ready for Build

Ensure the cell has an approved specification and is ready for implementation.

**Prerequisites Check**:
```bash
# Check workflow state
CURRENT_APP=$(yq eval '.current_app' .cbs-workflow-state)
CURRENT_PHASE=$(yq eval '.current_phase' .cbs-workflow-state)

# Get cell name (from parameter or context)
if [ -z "$CELL_NAME" ]; then
  CELL_NAME=$(yq eval '.active_cell' .cbs-workflow-state)
  if [ -z "$CELL_NAME" ] || [ "$CELL_NAME" = "null" ]; then
    echo "‚ùå No cell specified"
    echo "Usage: cbs cell build <cell_name>"
    exit 1
  fi
fi

# Validate cell specification exists
CELL_SPEC_PATH="applications/$CURRENT_APP/cells/$CELL_NAME/ai/spec.md"
if [ ! -f "$CELL_SPEC_PATH" ]; then
  echo "‚ùå Cell specification not found: $CELL_SPEC_PATH"
  echo "Create cell spec first: cbs cell design $CELL_NAME"
  exit 1
fi

# Check spec is approved (not in draft state)
if grep -q "Status: Draft\|Status: Pending" "$CELL_SPEC_PATH"; then
  echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  Cell specification not yet approved"
  echo "Approve spec first or use: cbs cell refine $CELL_NAME"
  read -p "Continue anyway? (y/N): " -n 1 -r
  if [[ ! $REPLY =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]; then
    exit 1
  fi
fi
```

**Cell Analysis**:
- Extract cell metadata (id, language, category, purpose)
- Parse message contracts (subscribe/publish subjects)
- Identify dependencies and communication patterns
- Validate CBS compliance of specification

```

</step>

<step number="3" name="execute_implementation_tasks">

### Step 3: Execute Implementation Tasks

Implement the cell following the generated tasks using TDD approach.

**TDD Implementation Cycle**:
```bash
# For each major task
for task in $MAJOR_TASKS; do
  echo "üî® Starting task: $task"
  
  # Execute subtasks in order
  for subtask in $SUBTASKS; do
    echo "  üìù Executing: $subtask"
    
    # Implement subtask with TDD
    # 1. Write tests first (if test subtask)
    # 2. Implement minimal code to pass tests
    # 3. Refactor while keeping tests green
    # 4. Validate CBS compliance
    
    # Mark subtask complete
    update_task_status "$subtask" "completed"
  done
  
  # Mark major task complete
  update_task_status "$task" "completed"
  echo "‚úÖ Completed task: $task"
done
```

**CBS-Specific Implementation Guidelines**:
- **Bus Registration**: Always implement Cell trait first
- **Message Handling**: Implement exact message contracts from spec
- **Error Handling**: Publish error envelopes on failures
- **Logging**: Use `log.d/i/w/e` with correlation IDs
- **Testing**: Unit tests for logic, integration tests for bus communication

</step>

<step number="4" name="validate_cell_implementation">

### Step 4: Validate Cell Implementation

Ensure the implemented cell follows CBS principles and works correctly.

**Validation Suite**:
```bash
# Run cell-specific tests
cd "applications/$CURRENT_APP/cells/$CELL_NAME"
case "$CELL_LANGUAGE" in
  "dart")
    flutter test
    ;;
  "rust") 
    cargo test
    ;;
  "python")
    pytest
    ;;
esac

# Run CBS validation
cbs validate --specs "applications/$CURRENT_APP/cells/$CELL_NAME"

# Test bus communication
cbs cell debug $CELL_NAME --test-messages

# Validate isolation
cbs isolation validate --cell $CELL_NAME
```

**CBS Compliance Checks**:
- ‚úÖ **Cell Trait**: Properly implements id(), subjects(), register()
- ‚úÖ **Bus-Only**: No direct imports or calls to other cells
- ‚úÖ **Message Contracts**: Implements exact subjects from specification
- ‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Publishes error envelopes appropriately
- ‚úÖ **Testing**: Adequate test coverage for logic and integration
- ‚úÖ **Logging**: Proper logging with correlation IDs

</step>

<step number="5" name="integration_testing">

### Step 5: Integration Testing

Test the cell's integration with the broader CBS system.

**Integration Test Types**:

**Message Flow Testing**:
```bash
# Test complete message flows involving this cell
cbs messages trace $CELL_NAME --test-flow

# Example: If this is auth_logic cell
# Test: UI ‚Üí auth_logic ‚Üí user_store ‚Üí auth_logic ‚Üí UI
# Verify: Complete authentication flow works end-to-end
```

**Multi-Cell Scenarios**:
```bash
# Test scenarios involving multiple cells
# Start minimal CBS system with this cell + dependencies
# Send real messages through bus
# Verify expected behavior and responses
```

**Error Scenario Testing**:
```bash
# Test error handling and recovery
# Simulate network failures, invalid messages, timeouts
# Verify cell publishes appropriate error envelopes
# Confirm system remains stable
```

**Performance Testing**:
```bash
# Test cell performance under load
# Verify message processing times
# Check memory usage and resource consumption
# Validate concurrent message handling
```

</step>

<step number="6" name="update_workflow_and_complete">

### Step 6: Update Workflow and Complete

Update workflow state and mark cell as implemented.

**Workflow State Updates**:
```bash
# Mark cell as implemented
TIMESTAMP=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)

yq eval "
  .phases.implementation.completed_cells += [\"$CELL_NAME\"] |
  .phases.implementation.status = \"in_progress\" |
  .last_updated = \"$TIMESTAMP\"
" .cbs-workflow-state > .cbs-workflow-state.tmp

mv .cbs-workflow-state.tmp .cbs-workflow-state

# Create completion snapshot
cbs iterate "Completed implementation of $CELL_NAME cell"
```

**Completion Notification**:
```bash
echo "üéâ Cell Implementation Complete!"
echo ""
echo "‚úÖ Cell: $CELL_NAME"
echo "üìÅ Location: applications/$CURRENT_APP/cells/$CELL_NAME"
echo "üß™ Tests: All passing"
echo "üöå Bus Integration: Validated"
echo "üîí Isolation: Confirmed"
echo ""
echo "üîÑ Next Steps:"
echo "1. Build another cell: cbs cell build <next_cell>"
echo "2. Test integration: cbs cells debug"
echo "3. Add features: cbs feature add <feature_name>"
echo "4. Deploy application: cbs app deploy"
```

**Documentation Updates**:
- Update cell map with implemented cell
- Generate updated architecture documentation
- Update application README with cell status
- Create implementation summary

</step>

# cbs-agent

Purpose: One place for CBS agent instructions, standards, and developer commands. Cell-first, app-aware.

- Commands: see `scripts/cbs-agent/`
- Instructions: see `cbs-agent/instructions/`
- Standards: see `cbs-agent/standards/`
- App spec: add `applications/<app>/ai/app_spec.md` using the template in `cbs-agent/templates/app_spec.md`

Notes
- Existing scripts under `scripts/agent-os/` still work and delegate to `scripts/cbs-agent/`.
- Canonical cell specs remain in `applications/<app>/cells/<cell>/ai/spec.md`.

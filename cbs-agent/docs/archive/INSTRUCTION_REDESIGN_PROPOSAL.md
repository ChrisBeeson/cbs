# CBS Instructions Redesign Proposal

## 🎯 Core Problem

Current instructions are confusing, redundant, and don't match the actual user workflow. We need **intuitive, action-oriented names** that match what users actually want to do.

## 🧠 Deep Analysis: What Users Really Need

### **User Mental Model:**
```
"I want to..." → Clear instruction file
├─ create an app → app-create.md
├─ refine my app idea → app-refine.md  
├─ break app into cells → app-breakdown.md
├─ refine a cell design → cell-refine.md
├─ add a feature → feature-add.md
├─ build a cell → cell-build.md
├─ fix cell communication → cells-debug.md
└─ deploy my app → app-deploy.md
```

## 📋 Proposed New Structure

### **Application Level (`instructions/app/`)**
```
app/
├── app-create.md          # Create new CBS application
├── app-refine.md          # Iterate on application specification  
├── app-breakdown.md       # Break application into cells
└── app-deploy.md          # Deploy completed application
```

### **Cell Level (`instructions/cell/`)**
```
cell/
├── cell-design.md         # Design individual cell specification
├── cell-refine.md         # Iterate on cell specification
├── cell-build.md          # Implement cell from specification
└── cell-debug.md          # Debug cell issues and communication
```

### **Feature Level (`instructions/feature/`)**
```
feature/
├── feature-add.md         # Add new feature to existing application
├── feature-refine.md      # Iterate on feature requirements
└── feature-remove.md      # Remove feature from application
```

### **System Level (`instructions/system/`)**
```
system/
├── cells-debug.md         # Debug inter-cell communication
├── messages-trace.md      # Trace message flows between cells
├── isolation-validate.md  # Validate cell isolation compliance
└── performance-optimize.md # Optimize cell and message performance
```

### **Meta Level (`instructions/meta/`)**
```
meta/
├── cbs-context.md         # CBS principles and standards (keep)
├── workflow-state.md      # Workflow state management (keep)
├── pre-flight.md          # Pre-execution checks (keep)
└── post-flight.md         # Post-execution validation (keep)
```

## 🎨 Creative Command Mapping

### **Intuitive User Commands:**
```bash
# Application lifecycle
cbs app create my_chat_app              # app-create.md
cbs app refine                          # app-refine.md  
cbs app breakdown                       # app-breakdown.md
cbs app deploy                          # app-deploy.md

# Cell development
cbs cell design user_auth               # cell-design.md
cbs cell refine user_auth               # cell-refine.md
cbs cell build user_auth                # cell-build.md
cbs cell debug user_auth                # cell-debug.md

# Feature management
cbs feature add notifications           # feature-add.md
cbs feature refine notifications        # feature-refine.md
cbs feature remove old_search           # feature-remove.md

# System debugging
cbs cells debug                         # cells-debug.md
cbs messages trace user_auth            # messages-trace.md
cbs isolation validate                  # isolation-validate.md
```

## 🔄 Migration Strategy

### **Phase 1: Create New Structure**
1. **Create new directories** with intuitive structure
2. **Migrate good content** from existing files
3. **Create missing instructions** for common user needs
4. **Update CLI commands** to match new structure

### **Phase 2: Remove Redundancy**
1. **Delete outdated files** that don't match user needs
2. **Consolidate duplicated logic** (execute-task vs execute-tasks)
3. **Remove Agent OS artifacts** that aren't CBS-specific
4. **Clean up confusing naming**

### **Phase 3: Enhance Missing Workflows**
1. **Add debugging workflows** for cell communication issues
2. **Create performance optimization** instructions
3. **Add deployment and production** workflows
4. **Create troubleshooting guides**

## 🚀 Revolutionary Ideas

### **1. Context-Aware Instructions**
```bash
# Instructions that adapt based on current workflow state
cbs next                    # Shows what you can do next based on current phase
cbs fix                     # Automatically suggests fixes for current issues
cbs why                     # Explains why current step is needed
```

### **2. Smart Workflow Suggestions**
```bash
# AI suggests next logical steps
cbs suggest                 # "Based on your app spec, you might want to..."
cbs alternatives            # "Instead of 5 cells, consider 3 cells with..."
cbs optimize               # "Your message flow could be simplified by..."
```

### **3. Interactive Development**
```bash
# Conversational development flow
cbs chat "I want to add real-time features"  # Starts interactive feature addition
cbs explain user_auth                         # Explains current cell design
cbs improve performance                       # Suggests performance improvements
```

### **4. Template-Based Quick Start**
```bash
# Pre-built application templates
cbs create --template chat_app my_chat       # Creates chat app with typical cells
cbs create --template crud_api my_api        # Creates CRUD API with standard cells
cbs create --template realtime_dashboard     # Creates real-time dashboard
```

## 📊 Files to Delete (Outdated/Redundant)

### **Immediate Deletion Candidates:**
- ❌ `analyze-product.md` - Replaced by `app-create.md`
- ❌ `create-spec.md` - Confusing, replaced by specific `app-*` and `cell-*` files
- ❌ `execute-task.md` - Redundant with `execute-tasks.md`
- ❌ `plan-product.md` - Replaced by `app-create.md`

### **Files to Rename/Refactor:**
- 🔄 `execute-tasks.md` → `cell-build.md` (clearer name)
- 🔄 `create-cell.md` → `cell-create.md` (consistent naming)
- 🔄 `execute-cell-spec.md` → `cell-design.md` (clearer purpose)
- 🔄 `create-tasks.md` → `cell-tasks-generate.md` (specific purpose)
- 🔄 `post-execution-tasks.md` → `cell-complete.md` (clearer name)

## 🎯 User Experience Goals

### **Before (Confusing):**
```bash
User: "How do I refine my cell specification?"
Current: "Uh... maybe execute-cell-spec.md? Or create-spec.md?"
```

### **After (Intuitive):**
```bash
User: "How do I refine my cell specification?"
New: "Use: cbs cell refine <cell_name> (cell-refine.md)"
```

### **Before (Redundant):**
```bash
execute-task.md vs execute-tasks.md - Which one do I use?
```

### **After (Clear):**
```bash
cell-build.md - Build a specific cell
feature-add.md - Add a feature (may involve multiple cells)
```

## 💡 Out-of-the-Box Ideas

### **1. Workflow Shortcuts**
```bash
cbs quick-start chat        # Creates chat app + breaks down + designs cells
cbs feature-sprint auth     # Spec → design → implement feature in one flow
cbs cell-sprint user_store  # Design → implement → test cell in one flow
```

### **2. Learning Mode**
```bash
cbs learn                   # Interactive tutorial mode
cbs explain --why           # Explains reasoning behind recommendations
cbs best-practices cell     # Shows best practices for current context
```

### **3. Collaboration Features**
```bash
cbs share-spec user_auth    # Share cell spec for review
cbs review-changes          # Review all changes since last iteration
cbs team-sync              # Sync with team's cell specifications
```

### **4. Advanced Debugging**
```bash
cbs trace message user.login          # Trace message through cell chain
cbs analyze bottlenecks               # Find performance issues
cbs suggest-optimizations             # AI-powered optimization suggestions
```

This redesign makes the CBS agent **intuitive**, **powerful**, and **aligned with how users actually think**. What do you think of this approach?

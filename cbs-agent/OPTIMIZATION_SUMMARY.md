# CBS Agent Optimization Summary

## Overview
Simplified and condensed the CBS agent folder structure by removing redundancy, consolidating functionality, and creating a unified CLI interface.

## Major Changes

### üóÇÔ∏è Directory Structure Simplified
**Before**: 7 top-level directories with scattered functionality
**After**: 5 focused directories with clear purposes

### üîß Scripts Consolidated
**Removed**:
- `scripts/agent-os/` - Wrapper scripts (6 files)
- `scripts/cbs-agent/` - Duplicate wrapper scripts (6 files)
- Deprecated guard scripts (`cell_guard.sh`, `cell_import_guard.sh`)
- Simple wrappers (`milestone_commit.sh`, `validate_dna.py`)

**Added**:
- `scripts/cbs` - **Unified CLI tool** that provides single entry point
- Moved tools from `tools/` to `scripts/` with clearer names

### üìö Documentation Consolidated  
**Removed**:
- `commands/` directory (7 files) - Duplicated `instructions/core/`
- 5 separate standards files scattered across subdirectories
- 3 deprecated CSS/HTML/JS style files

**Added**:
- `standards/cbs-standards.md` - **Single consolidated standards file**
- All code style, tech stack, best practices, and CBS rules in one place

### üõ†Ô∏è Enhanced Functionality
**Unified CLI** (`cbs`) provides:
```bash
cbs validate [--specs|--envelopes|--map]  # Enhanced validation
cbs cell <action> [args...]               # Cell management
cbs work <app> <cell>                     # Combined context + focus
cbs context/focus/isolation               # Individual tools
```

**Enhanced validation** (`cbs-validate-spec`):
- Options for specific validation types
- Better error reporting and progress indicators

## File Count Reduction
- **Before**: ~45 files across scattered directories
- **After**: ~25 files in organized structure
- **Reduction**: ~44% fewer files

## Key Benefits

### üéØ Single Entry Point
- `cbs` command provides unified interface
- No need to remember multiple script locations
- Consistent help and usage patterns

### üìñ Consolidated Documentation
- All standards in one comprehensive file
- No hunting across multiple directories
- Clear hierarchy and cross-references

### üßπ Eliminated Redundancy
- No more wrapper scripts that just delegate
- No duplicate content across files
- No deprecated files lingering

### üîç Improved Discoverability
- Clear directory purposes
- Logical script naming (`cbs-cell-create` vs `cbs-cell`)
- Comprehensive README with examples

## Migration Guide

### Old ‚Üí New Commands
```bash
# Old scattered approach
scripts/agent-os/cbs-app-context my_app
scripts/agent-os/cbs-cell-focus my_cell
scripts/validate_spec.py
scripts/generate_cell_map.py

# New unified approach  
cbs work my_app my_cell                   # Sets context + focus
cbs validate                              # All validation + map generation
```

### Old ‚Üí New Documentation
```bash
# Old scattered files
standards/agent_os_standards.md
standards/cbs-cell-standards.md  
standards/code-style/rust-style.md
standards/tech-stack.md
standards/best-practices.md

# New consolidated file
standards/cbs-standards.md                # Everything in one place
```

## Maintained Compatibility
- All core functionality preserved
- Individual tools still available (`cbs-app-context`, etc.)
- Existing instructions and templates unchanged
- Cell specifications and validation unchanged

## Next Steps
1. Update any external references to removed files
2. Add `cbs-agent/scripts/` to PATH for easy access
3. Use `cbs --help` to explore unified interface
4. Refer to `standards/cbs-standards.md` for all development standards

> Spec: Enhanced Bus Monitor Cell with Channel Info and Descriptions
> Created: 2025-09-15

## Overview

Enhance the CBS bus monitor cell to display channel information, payload types, and user-friendly descriptions for better system observability. This isolated cell will subscribe to all bus messages and provide enhanced monitoring capabilities while maintaining complete separation from other cells through bus-only communication.

## User Stories

### Developer System Monitoring

As a developer monitoring the CBS system, I want the bus monitor cell to display the NATS subject, payload type, and human-readable description for each captured message, so that I can understand system flows without examining cell code.

The developer sees the bus monitor cell capturing and displaying enhanced message information: NATS subject (e.g., "cbs.greeter.say_hello"), extracted payload type (e.g., "Name"), and description (e.g., "Processes user name input for greeting generation"). The monitor cell operates independently, receiving all bus traffic via its wildcard subscription.

### Enhanced Cell Observability

As a system architect, I want each cell's messages to be self-documenting through schema descriptions, so that the bus monitor cell can provide professional system observability without requiring cell modifications.

The bus monitor cell receives messages with optional description fields and displays them in a clean interface. Cell developers can include descriptions in their message schemas, and the monitor cell automatically shows this context, making the distributed system easier to understand and debug.

### Isolated Monitoring Architecture

As a developer, I want the bus monitor to be a completely isolated cell that only communicates through the bus, so that it can be added or removed without affecting any other system components.

The bus monitor cell subscribes to `cbs.>` wildcard pattern, captures all messages, and maintains its own state. It can be instantiated by the Body, removed entirely, or run on a separate machine without any impact on other cells. All enhancements stay within this single cell's boundaries.

## Spec Scope

1. **Enhanced Bus Monitor Cell** - Upgrade existing BusMonitorCell to display channel, payload type, and descriptions
2. **Schema Description Support** - Add optional description field to CBS Envelope schema
3. **Payload Type Extraction** - Parse schema field to extract and display payload type names
4. **Description Registry** - Build lookup system within the monitor cell for schema descriptions
5. **UI Improvements** - Enhance message display with professional layout showing new information

## Out of Scope

- Modifications to other cells (monitor cell remains isolated)
- Inter-cell direct communication (bus-only communication maintained)
- Real-time schema validation or enforcement
- Message filtering or search functionality (monitor displays all captured messages)
- Historical persistence beyond current session

## Expected Deliverable

1. Enhanced BusMonitorCell with channel, payload type, and description display
2. Updated CBS Envelope schema supporting optional description field
3. Clean, professional UI maintaining current performance with additional information display

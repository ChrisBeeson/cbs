# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement modular CBS cells for Flutter Flow Web that provide real-time bus message monitoring and reusable flow text components with toggle functionality. The bus monitor cell captures all CBS messages using wildcard subscriptions and displays them in a color-coded, timestamped UI list, while the flow text cell provides a standalone, toggleable "Flow" text component. This enhances system observability and establishes a foundation for modular, reusable UI components in the CBS architecture.

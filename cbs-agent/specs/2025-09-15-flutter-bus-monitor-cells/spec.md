> Spec: Flutter Bus Monitor and Flow Text Cells
> Created: 2025-09-15

## Overview

Implement modular CBS cells for Flutter Flow Web that provide real-time bus message monitoring and reusable flow text components with toggle functionality. This enhances system observability and creates a foundation for modular, reusable UI components in the CBS architecture.

## User Stories

### Real-time System Monitoring

As a developer or system administrator, I want to see all CBS  bus messages in real-time, so that I can monitor system activity, debug issues, and understand message flow patterns.

The user opens the Flutter Flow Web application and sees a live feed of all messages flowing through the CBS bus on the right side of the screen. Messages are color-coded by service type (UI=blue, logic=green, errors=red), timestamped, and automatically scroll to show the latest activity. The user can clear the message history with a single button click.

### Modular Flow Text Management

As a UI developer, I want to toggle the visibility of the "Flow" text component independently, so that I can control the visual presentation without affecting other system components.

The user sees a prominent "Flow" text display on the left side with modern styling and glow effects. A toggle button allows instant show/hide functionality with appropriate visual feedback (eye icons). The flow text component is completely modular and can be reused in other parts of the application.

### Component Reusability

As a developer, I want flow text and bus monitoring as separate, reusable cells, so that I can integrate them into other CBS applications without code duplication.

Each component (bus monitor, flow text) exists as an independent cell with its own dependencies, tests, and configuration. Components can be imported and used in any CBS Flutter application, maintaining consistent behavior and styling across the system.

## Spec Scope

1. **Bus Monitor Cell** - Create a cell that subscribes to all CBS messages using wildcard patterns and displays them in a real-time UI list
2. **Flow Text Cell** - Extract the "Flow" text into a standalone, reusable widget component with toggle functionality
3. **UI Integration** - Update main Flutter UI to display bus messages alongside flow text in a split-screen layout
4. **Message Management** - Implement message clearing, auto-scrolling, and color-coded display based on message types
5. **Modular Architecture** - Structure each component as independent cells with proper CBS interfaces and testing

## Out of Scope

- Message filtering or search functionality
- Message persistence across application restarts  
- Advanced message analytics or statistics
- Integration with external monitoring systems
- Custom message routing or transformation
- Multi-user or collaborative monitoring features

## Expected Deliverable

1. Flutter web application displays real-time CBS bus messages in a scrollable list with timestamps and color coding
2. Toggle button successfully shows/hides the "Flow" text component with smooth visual transitions
3. Both bus monitor and flow text function as independent, reusable cells that can be imported into other CBS applications

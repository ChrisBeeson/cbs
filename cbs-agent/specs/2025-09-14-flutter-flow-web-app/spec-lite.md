# Spec Summary (Lite)

Create a Flutter web application built entirely with CBS cells that displays "Flow" centered on a webpage, using self-contained application directories for complete isolation. Each application lives in `applications/{app_name}/` with its own cells, configuration, and documentation, enabling rapid application development and deployment by switching between applications using command-line arguments (`cargo run -p body -- --app flutter_flow_web`).

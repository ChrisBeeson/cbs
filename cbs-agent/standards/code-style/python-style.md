## Python Style

- Format with Black (line length 100); lint with Ruff.
- Python >= 3.11, prefer type hints; enforce on public functions.
- Use `pytest` for tests; keep tests close to code in `tests/`.
- Avoid complex metaprogramming; choose readability.
- Small, focused modules; clear names; early returns.

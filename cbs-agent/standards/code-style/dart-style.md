## Dart/Flutter Style

- Follow `dart format`; CI runs `flutter analyze` and `flutter test`.
- Prefer immutable data, small widgets/functions.
- Use explicit types for public APIs; avoid dynamic.
- Keep files short; one widget/class per file when feasible.
- Document public classes and functions concisely.

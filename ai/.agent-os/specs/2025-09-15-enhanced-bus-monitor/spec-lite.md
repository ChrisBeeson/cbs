# Spec Summary (Lite)

Enhance the CBS bus monitor to display channel information, payload types, and user-friendly descriptions for better system observability and developer experience. The enhancement includes adding description metadata to the CBS envelope schema and updating the UI to show channel (NATS subject), payload type identification, and human-readable descriptions for each message, making the system more professional and easier to debug.

# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-14-flutter-flow-web-app/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### Flutter Web Cell Framework
- **CBS Dart SDK**: Create `cbs_bus_dart` package that mirrors the Rust `body_core` traits and interfaces
- **Cell Trait Implementation**: Implement `Cell` trait in Dart with `id()`, `subjects()`, and `register()` methods
- **Message Bus Integration**: Connect Flutter cells to CBS message bus via WebSocket or HTTP API bridge
- **Web Compilation**: Configure Flutter for web compilation with proper build artifacts

### Self-Contained Application System
- **Application Directory Structure**: Each application in `applications/{app_name}/` with complete isolation
- **Application Configuration**: Each app has `app.yaml` defining its cells, dependencies, and configuration
- **Cell Registry**: Implement dynamic cell loading from application-specific cell directories
- **Shared Cell Support**: Reference shared cells from `shared_cells/` directory across applications

### Web UI Architecture
- **Responsive Design**: Center "Flow" text with responsive typography that works on all screen sizes
- **Modern Styling**: Clean, minimal design following current web design best practices
- **Performance Optimization**: Minimize bundle size and ensure fast loading times
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Support for modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### CBS Integration Points
- **Message Bus Bridge**: Create bridge component that translates between Dart/Flutter and CBS message formats
- **Envelope Serialization**: Implement JSON serialization/deserialization for CBS envelopes in Dart
- **Error Handling**: Proper error propagation between Flutter UI and CBS backend systems
- **State Management**: Use CBS message patterns for application state management instead of traditional Flutter state solutions

### Build System Integration
- **Unified Build Process**: Integrate Flutter web build into CBS workspace build system
- **Asset Management**: Proper handling of web assets and static files
- **Development Server**: Local development server that serves Flutter web app with hot reload
- **Production Build**: Optimized production builds with proper asset bundling and minification

### Application Loading Mechanism
- **Application Discovery**: Body component that discovers applications in `applications/` directory
- **Configuration Loader**: Parse `app.yaml` files and validate application structure
- **Dynamic Cell Registration**: Load cells from application-specific directories and shared cells
- **Path Resolution**: Resolve relative paths within application directories and shared resources
- **Validation**: Schema validation for application configurations and cell dependencies

## External Dependencies

### Flutter Web Dependencies
- **flutter**: ^3.0.0 - Core Flutter framework for web development
- **Justification**: Required for building web applications with Dart, provides comprehensive UI framework and web compilation

### CBS Dart SDK Dependencies  
- **http**: ^0.13.0 - HTTP client for communicating with CBS message bus
- **Justification**: Enables communication between Flutter cells and CBS backend via HTTP/REST API

- **web_socket_channel**: ^2.0.0 - WebSocket support for real-time communication
- **Justification**: Provides low-latency communication channel for CBS message bus integration

### Configuration Management
- **yaml**: ^3.1.0 - YAML parsing and serialization
- **Justification**: Required for parsing application configuration files (app.yaml)

- **serde_yaml**: ^0.9.0 - YAML serialization for Rust
- **Justification**: Enables parsing of application configurations in the body framework

### Development Dependencies
- **build_web_compilers**: ^3.0.0 - Dart to JavaScript compilation for web
- **Justification**: Enables proper web compilation and optimization for production builds

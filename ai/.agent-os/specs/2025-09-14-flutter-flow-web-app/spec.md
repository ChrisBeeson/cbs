> Spec: Flutter Flow Web Application with CBS Architecture
> Created: 2025-09-14

## Overview

Create a Flutter web application built entirely with CBS cells that displays the word "Flow" in the center of a webpage, demonstrating a complete cell-based web application architecture. This will establish the foundation for building complex web applications using the CBS modular architecture with configurable application switching capabilities.

## User Stories

### Web Application Display
As a user, I want to visit a web page that displays "Flow" in the center, so that I can see a working CBS-powered Flutter web application.

The user opens their web browser, navigates to the application URL, and immediately sees a clean, modern webpage with the word "Flow" prominently displayed in the center. The application loads quickly and demonstrates the power of the CBS cell-based architecture running in a web environment.

### Application Configuration Switching  
As a developer, I want to switch between different CBS applications by specifying application directories, so that I can easily deploy different cell compositions without code changes.

The developer runs `cargo run -p body -- --app flutter_flow_web` to load the complete Flutter web application from `applications/flutter_flow_web/`, or `cargo run -p body -- --app cli_greeter` to load the CLI greeter from `applications/cli_greeter/`. Each application is completely self-contained with its own cells, configuration, and documentation, enabling rapid application development and deployment.

### Cell-Based Web Architecture
As a developer, I want to build web applications using isolated, testable cells, so that I can create maintainable and scalable web applications following CBS principles.

Each piece of functionality (UI rendering, state management, event handling, data processing) is implemented as a separate cell that communicates through the CBS message bus, allowing for independent development, testing, and deployment of application components.

## Spec Scope

1. **Flutter Web Cell Framework** - Create Flutter/Dart cells that can render web UI and handle web-specific interactions
2. **Web UI Rendering Cell** - Implement a cell that renders the "Flow" text with modern styling and responsive design
3. **Self-Contained Application System** - Design applications as complete directories under `applications/` with their own cells, configuration, and documentation
4. **Application Loader** - Extend the body framework to load complete applications from application directories
5. **Flutter Web Integration** - Integrate Flutter web compilation with the CBS build system for seamless web deployment

## Out of Scope

- Complex interactive features beyond displaying text
- User authentication or session management
- Database integration for this initial implementation
- Mobile app compilation (web-only for this spec)
- Advanced styling or animations (keep it minimal and clean)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Working Flutter Web Application** - A deployable web application that displays "Flow" and can be accessed via web browser
2. **Self-Contained Application Loading** - Demonstrate switching between the Flutter Flow app (`applications/flutter_flow_web/`) and the CLI greeter app (`applications/cli_greeter/`) using command-line application selection
3. **Complete Cell Architecture** - All Flutter web functionality implemented as isolated, testable CBS cells following established patterns

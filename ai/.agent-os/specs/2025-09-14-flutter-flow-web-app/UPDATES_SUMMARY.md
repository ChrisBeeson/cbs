# Documentation Updates Summary

This document summarizes all the documentation updates made to reflect the new self-contained application architecture.

## âœ… Updated Documents

### Main Specification Files
- **`spec.md`** - Updated user stories and deliverables to reflect self-contained applications
- **`spec-lite.md`** - Updated summary to mention application directories and command-line switching
- **`sub-specs/technical-spec.md`** - Updated technical requirements for application directory structure
- **`sub-specs/api-spec.md`** - Complete API specification (already aligned with new architecture)

### New Architecture Documents
- **`sub-specs/improved-folder-structure.md`** - Complete self-contained application structure design
- **`sub-specs/updated-body-spec-format.md`** - Updated YAML configuration format for applications
- **`sub-specs/body-spec-format.md`** - Original body spec format (kept for reference)
- **`sub-specs/master-spec-updates.md`** - Required updates to master build specs

### Project Documentation
- **`/README.md`** - Updated with new application structure, commands, and examples
- **`/cells/README.md`** - Updated to show legacy vs. new structure, added migration guidance

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Changes Made

### Architecture Changes
1. **Self-Contained Applications**: Each app in `applications/{app_name}/` directory
2. **Command-Line Switching**: `cargo run -p body -- --app flutter_flow_web`
3. **Shared Resources**: Common cells in `shared_cells/` directory
4. **Application Configuration**: Each app has its own `app.yaml` file

### User Experience Changes
1. **Clear Application Separation**: No more mixing of different app code
2. **Easy Application Discovery**: `--list-apps` command to see available applications
3. **Environment Support**: `--env production` for environment-specific configurations
4. **Validation**: `--validate` flag to check application configurations

### Developer Experience Changes
1. **Focused Development**: Work within single application directory
2. **Template System**: `--new-app` command to create new applications
3. **Shared Cell Reuse**: Reference shared cells across applications
4. **Independent Versioning**: Each application can have its own version and dependencies

## ðŸ”„ Migration Path

### From Legacy Structure
```
cells/examples/greeter_rs/     â†’ applications/cli_greeter/cells/greeter/
cells/examples/io_prompt_name/ â†’ applications/cli_greeter/cells/io_prompt_name/
```

### To New Structure
```
applications/
â”œâ”€â”€ cli_greeter/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app.yaml
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ cells/
â””â”€â”€ flutter_flow_web/
    â”œâ”€â”€ app.yaml
    â””â”€â”€ cells/
```

## ðŸ“š Documentation Consistency

All documentation now consistently refers to:
- **Applications** instead of "body spec configurations"
- **Application directories** instead of scattered configuration files
- **Command-line application selection** instead of configuration file switching
- **Self-contained structure** instead of mixed cell directories

## ðŸš€ Ready for Implementation

The specifications are now complete and consistent for implementing:
1. **Application loading system** in the body framework
2. **Flutter Flow web application** as a complete example
3. **CLI greeter application** migration to new structure
4. **Shared cell system** for code reuse
5. **Configuration validation** and error handling

All documentation reflects the improved architecture where each application is completely isolated and self-contained, making CBS much more organized and maintainable.
